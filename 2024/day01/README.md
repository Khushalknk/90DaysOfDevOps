What is Devops?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines Software Development (Dev) and IT Operations (Ops). This approach helps deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. It focuses on encouraging communication, collaboration, and integration between the software development team and IT operations to manage the software development lifecycle. DevOps combines cultural philosophies, practices, and tools to increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high speed. This allows organizations to evolve and improve products faster than those using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed helps organizations better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

How DevOps Works?

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer separated. Sometimes, these two teams merge into one, where engineers work across the entire application lifecycle-from development and testing to deployment and operations. They develop a range of skills beyond just one function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams also integrate more closely with development and operations throughout the application lifecycle. When security is a focus for everyone on a DevOps team, it is sometimes called DevSecOps.

These teams use practices to automate processes that were traditionally manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tools that help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also allow engineers to complete tasks independently (like deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that would normally require assistance from other teams, further increasing the team's speed.

Why devops is important?

DevOps—the combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams-is an approach that allows faster development of applications and easier maintenance of existing deployments. By fostering stronger connections between Dev, Ops, and other stakeholders in the company, DevOps promotes shorter, more manageable iterations through best practices, automation, and new tools. DevOps is not a technology itself but encompasses organization, culture, processes, and tools. Initial steps usually include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), real-time monitoring, incident response systems, and collaboration platforms.
